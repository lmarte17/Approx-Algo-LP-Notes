# Approx-Algo-LP-Notes

This repository contains notes and materials from a course on Approximation Algorithms and Linear Programming.

## Overview

This collection explores computational approaches to NP-hard optimization problems through:
- Approximation algorithms with provable performance guarantees
- Linear programming theory and practical formulations
- Techniques for LP relaxations and randomized/deterministic rounding
- Primal-dual methods and their applications
- Analysis frameworks for establishing approximation bounds
- Semidefinite programming and advanced approximation methods

## Structure

Notes are organized by lecture topics and include examples, problem sets, and implementation exercises where applicable.

## Usage

These notes serve as a reference for concepts, techniques, and approaches in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms using linear programming.


##### These notes were created and organized using Claude from lecture transcripts and my additional notes.
