# Approx-Algo-LP-Notes

This repository contains notes and materials from a course on Approximation Algorithms and Linear Programming.

## Overview

The content covers:
- Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems
- Linear programming techniques and applications
- LP relaxations and rounding methods
- Analysis of approximation ratios and bounds

## Structure

Notes are organized by lecture topics and include examples, problem sets, and implementation exercises where applicable.

## Usage

These notes serve as a reference for concepts, techniques, and approaches in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms using linear programming.
